# **Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning**
## **Introduction**
This project aims to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant using machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression. The project includes a front-end interface developed using Django framework, comprising three main pages: home page, input page, and output page.

## **Usage**
**Home Page:** The landing page of the application, providing an overview of the project and options to navigate.<br>
**Input Page:** A form where users can input features of breast cancer tumors for classification.<br>
**Output Page:** Displaying the classification result (benign or malignant) based on the input provided

## **Dataset**
The project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. 

## **Model Training**
The logistic regression model is trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset using Python's scikit-learn library. The model is then serialized and stored in the /models directory for later use in the application.

## **Technologies Used**
Python<br>
Django<br>
HTML/CSS<br>
scikit-learn
