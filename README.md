# Breast-Cancer-Classification-using-Machine-Learning
Classified Breast Cancer using Logistic Regression
## **Introduction**
This project aims to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant using machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression. The project includes a front-end interface developed using Django framework, comprising three main pages: home page, input page, and output page.


## **Usage**
Home Page: The landing page of the application, providing an overview of the project and options to navigate.
Input Page: A form where users can input features of breast cancer tumors for classification.
Output Page: Displaying the classification result (benign or malignant) based on the input provided.

## **Dataset**
The project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

## **Technologies Used**
Python
Django
HTML/CSS
scikit-learn
